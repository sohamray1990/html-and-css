Document Types (DOCTYPE) :

The DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. Meaning to deal with previous versions of HTML.
If you don't include it, then a browser might interpret it in a different way than expected. We want to tell the user agent that this is a standard modern HTML document. We want it to follow the current specifiction.

The ROOT :

The <html> element represents the root of an HTML document.
Authors are encouraged to specify a lang attribute on the root html element, giving the document's language. This aids speech synthesis tools to determine what pronounciations to use, translation tools to determine what rules to use and so forth.
